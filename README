Description:
1. Incorporated AI 
2. Incorporated a Menu

To change the XML file and the animation:
Sprite sources, destinations, speeds, number of them.
MultiFrameSprite delays between frame updates, number of them.
Change how long the explosions last
Change how far a missle will travel
Change the min and max speed of the player
Change the number of any of the sprites other than the player
Change all of the locations, player is the only one who takes an exact
coordinate the rest of the sprites are randomly generated
Setup initial number of enemies
Setup player breathing room for the start
You can change almost anything through the xml


*MAKE SURE THE INITIAL VELOCITY MATCHES UP WITH THE CORRECT ROW OF THE SPRITE
(the way mine are, usually negative velocity will correspond to row 1 and 
positive velocity will correspond to row 0)

The Specs that I implemented are:
Enemy Class - used composite pattern to wrap MultiFrameClass with enemy features
in order for enemies to be any MultiFrame sub class
Menu Classes - your menu implimentation, but added a gravity parameter and a 
help section

The Specs that I was unable to implement are:  
NONE!!! ITS PERFECT!!!

Extras:
All sprites are feverishly sweat blood and tears made by yours truly.

Notes:
See help section inside my menu for detailed information

Enemey AI = if the player is within the attack range and in front of the enemy
then the enemy will increase X and Y velocity by the attack speed, the Y 
velocity will be set to 0 when it reaches a Y of within 20 of the player
this is to reduce jutter if you make it stop exactly on the player Y coord
because the player will not be holding to a constant Y coordinate, once these
conditions are no longer met the enemy resumes it's previous velocities from
before it was tracking the player
